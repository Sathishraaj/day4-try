The Boring Company (TBC) is an American infrastructure and tunnel construction services company founded by Elon Musk. Its ongoing and proposed projects are
 designed for intra-city ("loop") transit systems.

After six years TBC has completed one out of six publicly announced projects. The only operational one is situated inside the Las Vegas convention center (LVCC)
 and operates on limited days for loop travel during conventions. It connects the LVCC West Hall to the existing campus over a stretch of 1.7 miles with an average 
speed of 30mph in non-autonomous regular Tesla 3 cars that are steered by a driver, despite a promise to have 150mph average speeds and autonomous "sleek custom pods". 
The majority of Las Vegas local residents are not served by the LVCC limited transportation system. The TBC completed one tunnel for testing in Los Angeles County. During 
the opening of the test tunnel at the end of 2018, it was described as "just a regular Tesla driving through a paved tunnel".[8] Many other TBC projects have been announced and
 subsequently became inactive or were cancelled and are widely considered a failure. Proposed projects in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Baltimore were ultimately scrapped due 
to escalating cost calculations by TBC and inactivity by TBC. The Wall Street Journal described the lack of follow up from TBC as "ghosting American cities".

The Boring Company was formed as a subsidiary of SpaceX, before separating in 2018. As of December 2018, 90% of the equity was owned by Musk,
 with 6% held by SpaceX in return for the use of SpaceX resources during the startup of the company. Outside investments during 2019 changed the equity split.
